# SLIKV

![](static/table.jpg)

Turn [tabular data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) into a
lookup table in [sqlite3](https://sqlite.org/). This is a working prototype.
Some limitations: No customizations, the table definition is fixed and TEXT,
only.

> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS map (k TEXT, v TEXT)

As a performance data point, an example dataset with 1B+ rows can be inserted
and index in less than 2 hours on an
[nvme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express) drive (database file size about 400G).

## Motivation

Sometimes, programs need lookup tables to map values between two domains. A
dictionary is a perfect data structure as long as the data fits in memory. For
larger sets (millions of items, tens or hundreds of GB), a dictionary will not
work.

The *slikv* tool takes a two-column tabular file and turns it into an sqlite3
database, which you can query in your program. Depending on the size of the
data, you can expect 1K-50K queries per second.

## Usage

```
$ slikv -h
Usage of slikv:
  -B int
        buffer size (default 67108864)
  -C int
        sqlite3 cache size, needs memory = C x page size (default 100000)
  -I int
        index mode: 0=none, 1=k, 2=v, 3=kv (default 3)
  -o string
        output filename (default "data.db")
  -version
        show version and exit
```

## Performance

$ stat --format "%s" fixtures/sample-10m.tsv
